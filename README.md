Fisherstruder - A 1.75mm compact filament feeder for 3D printers. Direct drive, and with a cheap 608 roller bearing.

It can be coupled on a Nema17 with or without a reductor.

Fails at high speeds (>150mm/s), but it probably comes from my cheap MK8 bolt.
Ah, and it is annoying like hell if/when you want to access the internal. I should try to add a butterfly nut to release the idler part. At least it prints very quickly and is extremely robust (I was able to flatten the filament completely -- which did not improve grip!)
